Description             : Beautiful Doom is the grandfather of enhancement mods,
						  born in 2008, updated multiple times, and finally
						  updated again in 2015, after a long silence. Version 6.0
						  was an ultimate update that took it to the next level.
						
						  It's a mod that keeps original Doom gameplay unchanged 
						  but introduces lots of special effects and visual 
						  enhancements for deeper and more thrilling Doom 
						  experience. Practically every single object in Doom was
						  remade and updated, and many effects can be controlled
						  while using the mod.

Known Issues			: "Smarter" sprite clipping mode is recommended. If you
						  notice some issues like sprites bouncing up and down or
						  clipping through the floor, use "Smart" clipping.
				
						  If you play the mod with another wad that contains its own
						  animated textures which use parts of the Doom vanilla
						  textures (such as water, lava), the texture may freeze 
						  without showing any animation or special effects.

						  Performance issues can usually be mitigated by disablingIf
						  some visual effects under Options > Beautiful Doom Settings.
