Description             : Beautiful Doom is the grandfather of enhancement mods,
						  born in 2008, updated multiple times, and finally
						  updated again in 2015, after a long silence. Version 6.0
						  was an ultimate update that took it to the next level.
						
						  It's a mod that keeps original Doom gameplay unchanged 
						  but introduces lots of special effects and visual 
						  enhancements for deeper and more thrilling Doom 
						  experience. Practically every single object in Doom was
						  remade and updated, and many effects can be controlled
						  while using the mod.

Known Issues			: "Smarter" sprite clipping mode is recommended. If you
						  notice some issues like sprites bouncing up and down or
						  clipping through the floor, use "Smart" clipping.
				
						  Switching weapon sets during gameplay may cause issues.
