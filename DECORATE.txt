// You can play this mod without new monsters or without new items, etc.


// --------- ITEMS
#include "DECORATE/BD_INV.txt"

// --------- WEAPONS
/*
Comment this to play without weapons. Makes the mod largely compatible with other weapon mods.
ATTENTION: if you do this, you ALSO have to go to MAPINFO.txt and comment ALL lines there.
Otherwise it won't work because there will be no valid player class available
or it'll conflict with the player class(es) from the other mod you're using.

// --------- OBJECTS
/*
Comment these to play without objects. Might be necessary if you're playing 
with a WAD that contains its own decorations or replaces decoration sprites,
like Deus Vult 2 with portals instead of burning barrels.
